I have started many self-challenges, such as 30-day fitness challenges, coding challenges, building new habits, and more. However, I was unable to complete any of them due to giving myself many excuses.

This time, I am part of a 45-day coding challenge by Arsh Goyal, and I am determined to see it through with no looking back. I will be updating my progress every week on LinkedIn.

I am not rushing to complete the challenge but dedicating 1.5 hours a day to solve questions. I don't want to take up this challenge just for the sake of doing it; I want to see genuine progress in myself.
